    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    The seminar includes a hands-on session to get participants familiar with querying a relational database using SQL. Participants will need to install before the seminar

    <ul>
    <li> the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/">PostgreSQL database</a></li>
    <li> a database client with a graphical user interface such as <a href="http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/">DBeaver</a>. </li>
    </ul>

    Participants that are not confident or have troubles with the installation can schedule a meeting with the workshop facilitator before the seminar to go though the installation.
